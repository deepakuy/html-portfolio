<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a content creator passionate about shedding light on significant social issues, particularly those affecting Karnataka and the broader Indian society. My work covers a range of topics, including the education mafia, Hindi imposition, betting app scams, and MLM scams. To enhance my content, I often use AI-generated imagery, creating detailed, realistic images that support my narratives.
</p>
<p>Recently, I experienced a surge in popularity on my YouTube channel. One of my videos exposing the coaching industry mafia gained 4,000 subscribers and over 100,000 views, which was incredibly encouraging. This positive response has motivated me to continue creating impactful content. I'm also forming a new group and YouTube channel with some interested members, aiming to expand my reach and influence.
</p>
<p>Although I'm new to video editing, I'm actively learning and seeking advice on various aspects of content creation, from video editing rates to designing film posters. My goal is not just to highlight problems but also to propose solutions, making a real difference through my work.

I'm also mindful of content policies on platforms like YouTube. Recently, I had to delete and plan to re-upload a video after it received an 18+ restriction due to sensitive language. This experience taught me the importance of being careful with my content to ensure it reaches and resonates with a wide audience. My dedication to creating engaging and responsible content reflects my commitment to raising awareness and inspiring change.
